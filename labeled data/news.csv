TjBA6jy4ako,If Elon Musk comes out as Libertarian it would bring a whole new 3rd Political Party to the US Government We are all tired of Democrats vs Republicans for the last 250 years we need a 3rd Party and we need to allow ranked voting so People actually vote for a 3rd Party and not fear having their Vote not be useful,positive

TjBA6jy4ako,Elon looks fairly human for 3am Ive seen him doing these late night videos about crypto currency and he looked completely wasted wiped out Really bad for your health Elon take a rest from working sometimes Their very rapid expansion of car factories seemed a bit optimistic a few years ago and now seems like a perfect call Tesla need to put most of their resources into even more factories in more parts of the world On the politics side funding a moderate and centrist super PAC would be just great Lets resist extreme politics of all stripes Red Blue Green or polka dot Great idea Elon bring back moderate sensible centrist politics,positive

TjBA6jy4ako,Q Do you think we should be concerned about AI Elon A I have being saying this for about a decade now Yes I believe there should be some sort of regulatory body concerned with the safety of AI towards humamity How many times does he have to say this before somebody listens One of the reasons why they are developing General AI at Tesla is that they want to be amongst the first and be beneficial to humanity rather than take advantage in various derogatory ways OK there are people who believe that General AI will never be a threat to humans But isnt it prudent to make sure,positive
TjBA6jy4ako,We did make an announcement lol,positive

uynhvHZUOOo,Disappointing The two big complaints are due to their focus on the direct impacts from the environment over the next eighty years First they miss the feedback loops that the gradually escalating interim crises will create As rich countries are called upon for aid by their citizens theyll be less likely to help poorer countries witness the lack of COVID vaccines going to the poorest countries or even cooperate with other wealthy countries beyond lip service already evident at climate summits The economic disruption will accelerate as the climate crisis becomes more and more evident reducing the likelihood that anything ever gets done Second by pointing to the 3C increase at the end of the century they make it easy for people to treat this like a horror story that will maybe happen to strangers Thats a long time from now surely someone will fix the problem well before then They should be pointing to the unprecedented flooding in Germany the unprecedented heat wave in Australia the melting of permafrost in Alaska and Siberia the fires in the US west all happening now and all harbingers of worse to come People need to be scared about their own futures not that of their grandchildrens,negative

uynhvHZUOOo,The Climate Waits for No One Thirty years ago a friend of mine got into the green energy business and tried to pull me into it I asked him what for it isnt serious He said You have no idea how much money is being poured into it Everyone wants in on it politicians financiers businesspeople the lot He was right of course Yet no one wants to promote green energy in order to save the planet but only to swell up their pockets even more The declarations therefore remain in the assembly hall where they are stated necessary actions are ignored and the climate waits for no one It will keep deteriorating This week in Glasgow Scotland the 26th UN Climate Change Conference is taking place Officially it aims to bring parties together to accelerate action towards the goals of the Paris Agreement and the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change In reality the countries plan to do the exact opposite This years UN Production Gap Report which tracks the discrepancy between governments planned fossil fuel production and actual global production levels states the following Despite increased climate ambitions and netzero commitments governments still plan to produce more than double the amount of fossil fuels in 2030 than what would be consistent with limiting global warming to 15C 27F Energy sources and technologies do change but not according to what is best for the planet It changes according to the interests of politicians and money moguls and it never benefits the planet or the majority of its inhabitants namely all of us Since the climate waits for no one eventually it will catch up with us Earth is a closed system and in a closed system there are consequences to exploitation it hurts the abuser as well as the abused I dont know when or at what cost but eventually we will all have to realize that we cannot take beyond what we need We cannot keep exploiting Earth selfishly and thoughtlessly because it will turn against us Earth is like a submarine there is only so much oxygen on board If some crew members take more than their quota the rest will not have enough they will die and the submarine will sink along with those who exceeded their quota We need constant reminders that we are one system and we are all dependent on each other We need to genuinely grasp that selfishness hurts us just as being exploitative hurts others If we constantly remind ourselves that we are interdependent we will behave with more consideration and we will avoid the punitive impact of climate change The other option is to keep working as the UNs Production Gap Report states that we are planning to work and suffer natures unforgiving response I hope we wise up in time because everyone will pay the price for this mistake,negative

uynhvHZUOOo,At this point it has become irrelevant wether youre a denier or not action is needed on a massive scale to keep this world habitable for humans,negative

D-9aEmB5DhM,If someone ever has the audacity to tell me  WW2 was a long time ago I would love to bring them to my home and let them have a talk with my great grandfather who still wakes up from nightmares because a long time ago he watched his little sisters getting brutalized and murdered in their childhood home for the crime of being jewish,negative
uynhvHZUOOo,I feel saddened by the fact that most of the people dont give a f for whats happening and they dont want to look or contribute anything to reduce its effects,negative
uynhvHZUOOo,What the Economist didnt talk about is a lot of this is a local humanmade disaster Clearfelling rainforests for farms is a great short term plan but in the long term without returning nutrients to the land the farms turn to dust When I was little countries like Madagascar were tropic rainforest now the southern half is a desert Overusing the land isnt a new issue the Egyptian Empire collapsed due to environmental damage caused by a lack of crop rotation So now they blame climate change because it absolves them of their own failings,negative
MJQIQJYxey4,Lets see keep my electricity bill down AC  running in my house prevent further strain on an aging electric grid or AI Keep your damn Al it isnt changing my personal life in any drastic way,negative
MJQIQJYxey4,Solar power is the answer They need to put up their own solar panels Strain on the grid and the general public in the area is ridiculous and unfair Theyve got the money paid for the panels SMH,negative
uynhvHZUOOo,So start doing something about it people The govts dont want to care and they wont untill and unless we make them,negative
uynhvHZUOOo,What most climate models are only now starting to take into account is the process of climate change acceleration due to feedback loops  One example is fire and melting  It gets hotter  So you have more forest fires CO2 and permafrost melt Methane  That release make it hotter  So you have even more forest fires and permafrost melting  Which makes it even hotter  And so on  The process of climate change acceleration due to these feedback loops means it will not take as long to get to 3C as many believe right now,negative
MJQIQJYxey4,How about using the waste heat for district heating,negative
uynhvHZUOOo,I am very sorry to tell everyone but climates and weather patterns change  Because as human beings we only live a relatively short time we always think that the weather and climate we have experienced is the norm  If you watch a lot of documentaries as I do you will note that the climate has changed drastically in various parts of the world over the centuries and millennia  I am not saying we must do nothing to combat pollution waste etc but to panic and create all this frightening concern in young peoples minds is ridiculous  If we take reasonable steps as we have in the past we can mitigate any aspect of climate change that perhaps is caused by man  But there is nothing we can do about natural climate change which has always happened as scientists and geologists etc point out in their studies  We live on a volatile world And please let us see all the people on the Economist cut back their consumption and change their boilers and walk to work first,negative
uynhvHZUOOo,Global trade has just as much to do with mass poverty as weather as some countries are part of the global supply chain and others not so much,negative

uynhvHZUOOo,We need stop cutting down trees thats one of the reasons why theres floods because theres nothing to hold the water when it rains  we sometimes hear of landslides because theres no trees to hold the ground together  the trees breathe out oxygen which we breathe in  they breathe in carbon dioxide which we breathe out,negative

D-9aEmB5DhM,They were MURDERED Not killed MURDERED,negative
uynhvHZUOOo,This is the same dumb question weve been repeating for 30 years The reality is that back in the day only Europe was industrialized and the pollution from the Victorian era was a BIG problem but it was still only a fraction of the world Now however the ENTIRE PLANET is industrializing and its trying to be just as consumption based as the lucky Europeans who did it first The Malthusian pressures are going to boil over within the next few decades The only thing thats stopping them are the Americans who thought they could turn Afghanistan into Oklahoma We all know how that turned out,negative
PHVGL1BDXXU,Comment to the gentleman that used to be an addict and now works with addicts The man wasnt blaming He was explaining what incidents led him to drugs  War causes many people to become addicts One thing I learned in 20 years of counseling is never to discount anyones feelings  I am a female military veteran I was addicted for 25yrs to opiates,negative

MJQIQJYxey4,Heres an idea Lets electrify all our vehicles and homes at the same time But lets ddo it without fossil fuels or nuclear power and without building any more power grid What could possibly go wrong,negative
uynhvHZUOOo,When Florida goes underwater all the billionaires will realize their money and real estate are worthless Desalinization can both mitigate sea level rise AND feed fresh water deposits that are drying up And more solar power generation in the sunnier regions would help offset coal and oil emissions Modern countries should be taking the lead in this yet they dont and its the poorest ones that suffer because of it Heavy rain is already a problem in places like Vietnam where flooding happens regularly Coastal rail lines in England face a similar problem where the sea used to be half a kilometer away in some places just 50 years ago And its also very possible inner Australia will become sea again if low lying areas become inundated with above average levels of rainfall  its already happened once in Death Valley a few years ago transforming that into a desert swimming pool I dont know how big of a wake up call is necessary,negative

uynhvHZUOOo,If you waste your time thinking this is the leading threat to all life on earth you have your head in the sand The population crisis is the only issue The rapidly increasing population is pushing people to the fringes of habitable land so there will always be plenty of people to film so we can delude ourselves we are taking positive action,negative

uynhvHZUOOo,Fewer scenes from less advanced countries and more focus on the areas of the world where the people live who can DO something about it Do you think the average American or European can relate to Bangladesh Some of us care but we are already worried and educated about climate change Show more ocean rise in Manhattan blistering heat waves in Marthas Vineyard multimillion dollar houses burning down in California etc See And tell the Economist guy to shave that weird beard thing,negative

MJQIQJYxey4,I am an EE took a mechanical engineering class in the early 90s was not too interested in it But the professor was working on thermal chip cooling systems from what I understand is common tech in laptops now  Your laptop chip heats a fluid in a sealed tube then it boils off and cooled by a fan turning it back to a liquid It is taken for granted but without such a solution a slim laptop would not exist He pretty much stated without advances in thermodynamics and cooling eventually all the EE tech will come to a dead halt It is true,negative
MJQIQJYxey4,Ill be darned I had no idea It makes sense More processing results in more heating and more power usage which results in overtaxing the grid Never heard of water cooling of computing components before either I learned something new today So AI is the new gas guzzler Maybe we should stop using it for the sake of our planet and think for ourselves instead of making a computer do so,negative

MJQIQJYxey4,Graph at 121 is misleading 213M parameters with NAS first off no one is doing neural architecture search they have the architecture its transformer Transformers today are in the order of 100s Billions of parameters not millions So the number if the graph is right for 213M transformer which I doubt the real CO2 cost is 1000x higher if power consumption scales linearly with parameter count which it probably would,negative

uynhvHZUOOo,It is sad to realize that the more vulnerable people on the planet already suffer while they have a way and way less of a footprint on this problem and cannot have a huge impact on on changing this problem Meanwhile the people in the wealthiest countries dont notice much and continue to live in and consume in the same level they are used to While if they would even change a little bit of their behavior that would already make a huge impact and even more than the people who are more vulnerable to this problem But sadly most of the people in 1st world countries see it as a fairytale and choose money and comfort over perspective and progression of an advanced society that can offer anyones basic needs We have been poisoned by money and greed And the sad thing is that some people are even proud of that Wich disgusts me One day people will realize that you cannot eat money but then its already too late,negative
uynhvHZUOOo,To paint the metaphor we are passengers in a car that is hurtling towards a cliff in the dark and we dont know how far the drop is because we cant see the bottom And where were at now were only a few moments away from the front wheels of the car going over the edge   It might be a civilisational collapse that literally sends humanity back to the stone age The saddest part is we cant claim ignorance as a species Weve seen climate change coming for more than half a century now and were warned repeatedly by scientists I dont even blame oil companies the blame lies with the giant mass of average everyday people who continue to argue and obfuscate over doing anything   I grew up thinking the future would be like Star Trek You have no idea how disappointed I am with how it actually turned out,negative

uynhvHZUOOo,Its really sad that we have people paying the price so heavily in countries that minimally contribute to this problem And of course its also a problem that the last countries to feel the effects and realize how bad this is are the ones that have the most power to do something about it,negative
uynhvHZUOOo,I hate myself for saying this but the problem with this video is that people in the west are now used to seeing people in developing countries suffer Impacts on western life would probably have more of a punch,negative

uynhvHZUOOo,In the chill of manmade breeze we find  A dissonance with natures rhyme  Blasting air a stark divide  From the rhythms where life resides    Not adaptation but illusions wane  In the throes of our cooling reign  Making harder the dance of those  Bound in symbiosis where life flows    Biodiversity our fortress strong  Guarding against the tides so wrong  For no creature evolves alone  In the tapestry where life is sown    Each organism a vital thread  Woven in natures web widespread  No evolution without the dance  Of symbiotic bonds in endless trance    So let us heed this solemn call  To preserve the web lest it fall  For in biodiversity lies our key  To biosecurity our shared decree,negative

uynhvHZUOOo,People in denial are part of the problem,negative
uynhvHZUOOo,A lot of people think that global warming means well all just sweat a little bit more than usual  With both polar caps melting at an alarming rate they think oh well the coastlines will flood Im worried that all that additional weight from the oceans is causing major shifting of the earths plates  This may be what caused both the tsunami that devastated  Fukushima and the volcanic eruption near Tonga  I suspect that the climates rate of change will become exponential  I highly doubt that merely limiting the use of fossil fuels will stop climate change  If we are the cause of climate change then WE ARE THE CAUSE and not so much the technology   This is about our behavior towards the environment BEHAVIOR  Switching technologies say from fossil fuels to solar panels will probably make things much worse  because switching technologies is what we have been doing for hundreds of years in other words switching technologies is the same behavioral error Each new technology is just another reason to steal from our environment  How do we change our behavior  We know that the behavior in question is our economic behavior  Our economic rules of conduct are the problem  What is at the heart of our economic rules of conduct  Profit  We must profit We must get what we need to live  How do we define profit As of today we define profit in roughly 2 ways 1  Websters dictionary has 4 or 5 nice definitions 2 The capitalist definition  In my opinion the capitalist definition of profit reads something like this  profit  the requirement of draining the environment of all resources including ourselves because only profits matter   I would like to suggest a third and new way to define profit I think that in order for us to survive and repair the environment at no cost to us we must define profit as something like this  Profit  the least amount of damage to the environment  the equally shared distribution of product  How on earth can we live by such a definition of profit  We can keep our technology and our democracy but we must morph our capitalism with a lot of new sets of laws that will severely punish businesses that try to operate on the old definition of profit   We must create laws that restrict how much damage any one manufacturing process will cause  We need a new line of workers  that specialize in guarding and repairing the environment    This is all just the tip of the iceberg  Applying this strategy to every aspect of the entire global market is a daunting task  In my opinion any and all further processing of the environment  based on our current rules of economic behavior with false profit will destroy the entire environment  Imagine how much less damage will be caused to the environment when manufacturers can make products that can last a lifetime or longer and the manufacturers cant  go bankrupt so they dont have to worry about maintaining the company by robbing Peter to pay Paul   If you think we are just going to sweat a little bit think again because the  changes will be many and are going to be catastrophic,negative
PHVGL1BDXXU,I was a addict for 20 years no one wants this life but when you are depressed and lost hope the only thing that keeps you going is the drug u know its killing you and cost a lot but at the time u dont care I feel got these Men so much but forcing you to give up doesnt work you need to want to before its a success,negative
uynhvHZUOOo,I live in Luxembourg and climate change is really noticeable here A few years ago during the night temperatures would drop to about 10 degrees Celsius but now they barely drop to 5 degrees Celsius during the night Also snowfall would be very frequent and the snow could last for days but now it is much rarer and even when it does snow quite a lot the snow melts after a few hours,negative
uynhvHZUOOo,Were not scaring people nearly enough  Most people just think it will be someone elses problem or they think someone will figure out how to mitigate the problems and life will go on as usual,negative
PHVGL1BDXXU,While Babrak is doing a great an honorable thing trying to help these addicts his views on addiction and causes of addiction are deeply flawed Addiction isnt caused because a person is weak Drugs are a symptom of deeper causes like poverty depression loneliness etc these people are using drugs to mentally escape a horrible situation not because theyre weak,negative
uynhvHZUOOo,645 These places looks exactly the same as in Ghost Recon Wildlands A bit nostalgic tbh,negative
uynhvHZUOOo,The article was very balanced and at the same time very worrying I cannot see how this will be avoided and even greater temps will then follow i will not be around for it The main problem with all of this is not the science its us human beings are at our heart very selfish we will not stop wanting all the goodslifestyle that increases the temp of the planet yes we know its bad but we will still do it  Europe needs real hard borders as the migration effect of all this will be a disaster Doomed is the only word to describe it all,negative
uynhvHZUOOo,From Sydney recently over the past few years I have been noticing that we have a few dry and hot summers followed by wet and humid summers In 20192020 summer we had bushfires and droughts which were very devastating to farmers and people in the West Sydney suburbs were being engulfed by the flames In 2021 we had floods that affected many people including my Aunt who had to evacuate and lasted for a week So for the people thinking climate change only affects 3rd world country take my word for it 1st world countries get affected also,negative

uynhvHZUOOo,Reading some of the literature out there the consensus appears to be that limiting global warming to three degrees has come and gone and that the expected change will be worse,negative
uynhvHZUOOo,A big question is how long is the lag between creating emissions and the consequences to the planet The longer the lag the more trouble were in Id guess theres at least a 10 yr waiting period meaning all the greenhouse gasses which increasingly are coming from the Earth itself due to feedback loops and fires from the last decade have NOT yet caused the impact they eventually will,negative
uynhvHZUOOo,An important factor not covered in this film is that a 3C world is very likely to trigger a number of potentially very large selfreinforcing feedbacks  in other words unstoppable once triggered  For example the melting of circumpolar permafrost releasing methane  conversion of the Amazon Basin to a dry savannah ecosystem the collapse of the Antarctic ice shelves and ocean acidification is by no means an exhaustive list  And yet despite this governments still seem to be trapped in a dithering lethargic state of procrastination,negative
uynhvHZUOOo,Unfortunately air conditioning is not a viable means of adaptation because that itself is a massive contributor to climate change its a huge part of the problem,negative
MJQIQJYxey4,All that wasted heat could be turned to steam to power a generator to feed power back into the system,negative
uynhvHZUOOo,This video falls short on delivering the msg of emphatic action needed against Global warming With video only focusing on poor countries  the noncoverage of effects of global warming on developed countries is conspicuous As such developed countries have more say in global forums the climates change impact in such countries should have been included to compel them to take action as their own created catastrophe has now reached their doorsteps,negative
uynhvHZUOOo,The looming specter of global warming beckons an immediate collective response as escalating temperatures unleash havoc upon ecosystems and catalyze unprecedented shifts in weather patterns worldwide,negative
PHVGL1BDXXU,Gosh I would hate for somebody to be in the wrong place at the wrong time and NOT an addict and get taken by these men,negative
D-9aEmB5DhM,I learned about this in history class it is still sad to this day,negative
uynhvHZUOOo,Regardless of the temperature weather sea levels etc the real problem is massive overpopulation in countries least able to support large scale urban growth other than by slum building pollution on an epic scale and general squalor Any small human population with access to technology can survive and thrive in areas and in conditions of climate extremes from the arctic to the sahara but massive overpopulations even in areas of temperate weather and abundant resources will and do fail,negative
PHVGL1BDXXU,you cant say you helping someone and slap them in the face thats not being The Studied smh,negative
uynhvHZUOOo,What really scares me is the ignorance of older people I remember my dad saying  I remember 50 years ago the winters were so cold It was horrible There was snow from September till March Then he said something shocking I think the climate change turned the weather to the better He really doesnt have a sense for whats comming when climate change doesnt stop,negative

uynhvHZUOOo,I am from Romania and I have noticed many changes  It started to stop snowing in the winter and the summers became much warmer  Im turning 20 this month and I remember winters and summers being normal when I was a kid  I cant imagine how bad it will be in a few years I wish so badly I could do something It devastates me that most people are ignorant  It also annoys me and makes me lose hope in humanity Our future is destroyed We should stop having children so they dont have the same fate,negative
uynhvHZUOOo,New Zealand herewe have been getting wetter and warmer winters the lack of snow pack has been more evident year on year our glaciers are retreating faster and faster Frosts used to be commonplace even into spring and even a decade ago now I can just about count on my hands the number of frosts we have each winter Our summers are hotter and drier spring is borderline nonexistent This year Ive been having to mow my lawn weekly since the beginning of September when the ground should not be warm enough to sustain such growth well into October We get more extreme weather events and cyclones travel further south from the tropics in part due to weaker jetstreams as a result of warming and they stay wetter and stronger due to warmer oceans surrounding us The Tasman sea has been breaking record warm levels year on year in recent times The fact that Ive been able to witness these changes in my lifetime and they only seem to be accelerating in the last 510 years to the point that it is as noticeable as it is is absolutely terrifying And the number of people who STILL think its a hoax even here in NZ who voted in a Govt in our latest election who intend on doing nothing more than paying mere lipservice to climate and environmental issues just disgusts me,negative

uynhvHZUOOo,I think they should show how it could affect the first world specifically the US because many Americans dont care especially if the weather seems normal But heres how New Orleans could be underwater the mega drought could make the desert Southwest unlivable or Atleast become the new rust belt The South will face dangerous heat and wet bulb temperatures agriculture could be decimated by the mega droughts of the west and the places that arent as affected will become very expensive that it could could many social problems,negative

D-9aEmB5DhM,So hard to believe that there are people who deny that these events existed,negative
uynhvHZUOOo,No Heatwaves will not be the only consequence for Europe This will be the least severe result and much more devastating will be extreme flash floods interchanged with catastrophic droughts and very unusual temperatureweather anomalies caused by disrupted jet streams Also the rough weather will cause farmers to quit their jobs and the food prices will skyrocket This in return will trigger multiple military conflicts throughout the world and mass migration way before actual people displacement caused by climate change itself Also many countries rely on nuclear power plants located on the seacoast or near other bodies of water on which they rely Both the sea and sweetwater will become a danger to the facilities But imo the worst consequence could be a civil wars caused by the crisis in Europe and other countries,negative
uynhvHZUOOo,Im from the mountains of Rio de Janeiro On the past 10 years i have seen a dramatic diference in the weather here The amount of rain went up a lot in the summer hence the flood a city close to me had in the beginning of the year and the temperatures in the winter are really crazy now Used to be  around 810 degrees with some hotter and colder days but nothing really crazy But now we have 15 degree weather and some random days with 3 and feeling of 10 It might not be much for people from the north but IM IN A TROPICAL PLACE and we are not ready for cold climate and days of 30 degree weather in the middle of the winter,negative

uynhvHZUOOo,An error with the documentary is that it spends too much time covering remote communities It shouldve been made more relevant to the people whod typically watch the video As the delayers and science deniers often view climate change as something that happens only in distant countries and that impacts to their own regions will only be long into the future With populations in India and Bangladesh having the highest levels of acceptance of the reality of the climate crisis of all countries in the world,negative
