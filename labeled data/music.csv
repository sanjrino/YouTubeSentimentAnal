BY_XwvKogC8,Beautiful Clip  My interpretation    The setting is the protagonists Billie life path where the hallway represents the life she wants to follow and the doors leading to the rooms symbolize opportunities to engage in relationships with other people    Corridor Represents the path and life of the protagonist   Doors to rooms Doors symbolize people and rooms represent relationships with those people    The clip begins in a dark and empty corridor that is her life is sad and lonely even though she is in this depressed situation and she walks through this circumstance looking for a specific door someone  011 an open door to a bright room and someone ready for it Billie touched the doorknob but the person on the other side wasnt what she was looking for Without hesitation she closed the door without even looking back Feeling of this is not what I want and am looking for  025 The door in your hallway is already open but even so it opens wider bringing security and the feeling of being on the right path even though its still dark although less dark And keep looking  030 another door with some light another person and without hesitation Billie closes it  033 another door person extremely open but with a room even darker than the corridor someone more problematic As you can see this door was a little more difficult to close than the previous ones but without hesitation it closed  035 returns to a darkness that was seen at the beginning 036 Closed and narrow door barrier end of the path she wants to open the closed door person not willing but this is the door to achieve her goal She recognizes that it is a dangerous stormy windy place but she is willing to take the risk She runs after 053 stairs path is not easy 100 hand on head worry curves going after the person at the door 036 who at minute 103 is leaving the roomlife another person  Billie insists on this person who is running away from her but at the same time hasnt closed the door on her  discussion relationship demand 117 they enter a relationship together but through different doors visions feelings ideas and communication He is in front of her with dominion over her   125 she finds herself in this relationship completely alone and she knows she waits and then she leaves  145 leaves through the same door he entered understands his intentions   Back to darkness but he is still present in her life 153 this time he is standing still waiting for her but with a certain discomfort uncertainty  156 she throws him against the wall arguments pending situations blaming each other  213 he throws her against the wall and she gives in  217 the fight doesnt end well but it gives the feeling that they prefer to ignore direct darkness to a brighter environment  223 she brings him into her life they follow the corridor together accelerating the processes 228 a brief dark moment conflicts alternations   237 a new door Suddenly she lets go of his hand opens the door bright light they both enter  240 Freedom she freed herself from the feeling of darkness she is alone living well getting to know things 300 giving space for sexuality knowing herself  335 the environment starts to lose light she looks back remembers the past he appears behind her she runs away 405 they fall into the relationship again conflicts darkness he attacks her arrests her  424 she falls to the bottom of the well she traps him he traps her Toxic dependent relationship even causing serious problems  449 they end smiling ignoring the problems and a brief 23 seconds of darkness and silence  Message   It is common to find people trapped in difficult and toxic relationships in which both parties seem unable to let go Even when they try to move on they end up returning to each other in a vicious and harmful cycle for both parties The problem seems to lie in the dynamics of dependence and the pattern of toxic behavior that permeates the relationship In these cases responsibility cannot be attributed to just one of the partners as both partners contribute to the perpetuation of this destructive cycle It is essential that both parties recognize the toxicity of the relationship and seek help to break this harmful pattern Your freedom and emotional health will be at stake if you dont take steps to free yourself from this harmful cycle,positive

BY_XwvKogC8,shouting this into the void This song has been helping me process very old grief When I was kid my neighborhood best friend was one of the few people to smile when they saw me It had been a few years since we were close I was 9 she was 10 and I remember finding her at a party and we both got so excited seeing each other again she smiled so big Ill never forget how it felt She always looked like Chihiro from Spirited away  and I loved Chihiro for that  That was the last time I saw her in real life A few months later her and her new baby nephew were murdered  they died because the killer hurt them then barricaded the door preventing EMS from getting in to save them Open up the door The last time I saw her was in a dream where I asked her if it hurt  she said it really did and then i never spoke to her again   Id never really acknowledged to myself how Spirited Away reflects my grief  until this song forced me to see it  where everything about its influences and lyrical connections force me to confront my loss In a very real sense this song put a closed door in my mind and Ive somehow always known what was behind it  but Ive never let myself try to open it  Wringing my hands in my lap when you tell me its all been a trap and you dont know if youll make it back I said no dont say that,positive
tgPyynCXWNs,This song fits my Daddy to a T except for a few things No beer in his hands and no cowboy boots  He was bulletproof too me,positive

b1kbLwvqugk,As someone who can be very sensitive to fatphobia Im really sad that she took that scene out Taylor has had an eating disorder and body image issues and that negativity is her and many other peoples realities Its her story and Im not at all offended by it I was actually touched by the vulnerability of including that in the video I see fatphobia on a daily basis for no reason other than to joke But this was spreading awareness to another difficult subject I understand it being a sore spot but it was wrong to pressure her to take that out  PS if you somehow see this Taylor or anyone that knows her please tell her that a girl named Penelope and SO MANY MORE stand by and love her Even if she feels we should find another guiding light Im not walking away,positive

XKWcAsT8Sqc,The imagery and visuals are sensational  represent everything Kanye has been talking about in this song  these last couple years   Everybody wearing the YZY GAP hoodie the new uniform of his envisioned society no logo no branding fashion eventually available for all to fight classism   Kanye at the eye of the storm in front of the light as he has said he is on this earth to deliver gods message connecting the people with gods messagethe lightthe divine  The tornado made from the new wave of humans represents COLLECTIVE power A force to be reckoned with when united  The final stills are the most powerful  fill me with immense energy  The tower of babel destroyed by the tornado the tower represents the societal structures playing god  controlling people lives Only the people uniting can tear the system down  The sinking ship is uncanny to the slave ships in the Atlantic slave trade triangle It is still on top of the water but it is slowly sinking because the media can misconstrue Kanyes words all they like but many of us are still mentally enslaved however more and more are waking up  the modern slave owners The devil are beginning to lose in this video game In Kanyes vision of the world they are submerged the devil is defeated however people need to come together  realise their own united power,neutral
